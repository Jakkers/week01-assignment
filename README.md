Week 01 assignment for Tech Educators

# Reflections

üéØ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

‚Ä¢ I was able to use semantic HTML elements and create a structure from sketing a wireframe.
‚Ä¢ Managed to overlay text on top by using CSS background-image.
‚Ä¢ Used flexbox including justify & align to position items and change layout.
‚Ä¢ also used float and display in conjunction with a list to dispay the nav bar in a responsive way.
‚Ä¢ Connected images for the background in CSS.

‚Ä¢ Some stretch goals include:

- Adding Anchor tags so links go to sections on the page.
- Spending time to add gradients to improve visibility for the user
- Making sure elements are responsive and work on any screen size. (to the best of my ability in the time without media queries)
- Removing underlines on links using text-decoration: none;

üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

‚Ä¢ I was unable to reach the goal of asigning a gradient over the section images to improve legibility for the user. (I have solved this since writing)

üéØ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

‚Ä¢ I was trying to find a way to do this all in CSS, I couldnt find too much on the subject online. I think going forward i'm going to speak with other class members who may have tackled the same issue or/and try adding a img in html and working from there. (Solved)
‚Ä¢ I solved the issue by creating an extra div box inside the section I wanted to add the linear gradient to in HTML and styling it in CSS.

(Optional)
üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

‚Ä¢ It was great to discuss what we made with each other, it was also useful to share whole screens so we could debug and discuss.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

‚Ä¢ The styling went well after the beggining.
‚Ä¢ I was struggling at the start, once elements started making more sense through trial and error, it was easier to make small changes.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).

‚Ä¢ unsplash.com for copywrite free images
‚Ä¢ chatgpt.com for generating placeholder text.

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

‚Ä¢ I encountered an error doing the anchor tags for example, this was down to not using the right syntax.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

‚Ä¢ Nothing specific, but I'd like to know if there are more elegant ways I could code.
